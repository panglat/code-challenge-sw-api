# The Star Wars API Test
This is a fictional Star Wars API Test app. The list can be sorted using the selector. Any list item can be clicked to display a modal with the planet detail.
At the bottom, there is a button called “Get more planets” to fetch more items. Once there are no more items, the button is not accessible anymore and a message is displayed.
